Over the past decade, the deep \HST\ Treasury surveys (GOODS, CANDELS,
CLASH) have proven to be the most effective programs for locating and
studying Supernovae (SNe) at high redshift.  These surveys have all
enabled ``piggyback'' SN searches (hereafter, the HST-SN surveys),
which have collectively accumulated scores of SN detections that reach
to uniquely high redshifts
\citep{Riess:2007,Dahlen:2008,Graur:2014a,Rodney:2014}.  Continuing in
this line of highly successful deep \HST\ surveys, the Hubble Frontier
Fields (HFF) director's discretionary program (PI:Lotz) now provides a
powerful new tool for the discovery of high-$z$ SNe.  What sets the
HFF survey apart from the previous HST-SN surveys is the unique depth
of each visit; with $\sim$4 orbits per filter per epoch, we can reach
$m_{lim,3\sigma}(F160W)\approx27.9 (AB)$, nearly 1 mag deeper than
CANDELS/CLASH per epoch. Gravitational lensing in the prime fields
also magnifies SN fluxes by factor $\mu\gtrsim2$, making it possible
to detect unique background events at extreme redshifts. 

In Cycle 21 the TAC awarded us 60 orbits and 15 non-disruptive ToO
triggers over 3 cycles to use in follow-up observations of SNe
discovered in HFF imaging and supplementary surveys. We are on pace to
expend all of these orbits in the first 2 years, primarily due to the
unexpected (and unprecedented) discovery of a multiply-imaged SN,
gravitationally lensed into an Einstein Cross
(Figure~\ref{fig:refsdal}, \citealt{Kelly:2015}).  {\bf We propose to
  extend our FrontierSN program into Cycle 23, so we can continue to
  provide the necessary follow-up observations to maximize the
  scientific return of this rich Frontier Frields SN sample.}

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf The FrontierSN Sample:} 
Through the first two years of the HFF program, our team has searched
for SNe in all imaging of the Frontier Fields clusters and parallel
fields.  We have also searched for SNe in the 10 complementary cluster
and parallel fields observed in the Grism Lens Amplified Survey from
Space (GLASS, PI:Treu, PID:13495), working jointly with the GLASS
team.  In the first two years of the FrontierSN program, we have
discovered 37 explosive transients reaching to $z=1.5$, which are
mostly normal Type Ia or Core Collapse SNe.  The bulk of our follow-up
observations have been expended on a small subset of unique and
peculiar objects behind the cluster, which are providing powerful new
tools for testing and improving cluster mass models.


Our primary science goal with
this sample is to measure \SNIa\ rates to $z\sim2.5$, yielding
improved constraints on \SNIa\ progenitor models.  These SNe will also
provide a check on possible evolution of the \SNIa\
population \citep{Riess:2006}, as well as unique tests for the mass
models of the Frontier Field clusters \citep{Riehm:2011}. Moreover,
this sample will extend the measurement of \CCSN\ rates to $z>1$,
giving us valuable direct measurements of the star formation rate
density \citep{Dahlen:2012}.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Follow-up Needed:} 
Although the Frontier Field survey enables the initial discovery of
SNe for ``free'', in order to reach any of these science goals we must
also be able to accurately distinguish \SNIa\ from \CCSNe, especially
at $z>1$.  Alas, the Frontier Field survey will not deliver coincident
optical$-$IR colors, which dramatically improve the discrimination
between red \SNeIa\ and blue \CCSNe.  The narrow observing windows
will also guarantee that high-z SN light curves are only partially
sampled by the Frontier survey epochs.  A well-sampled light curve is
necessary to enable
\SNIa\ light curve fitting for luminosity distance determination. 
Therefore, {\it we propose to obtain non-disruptive ToO imaging
observations for $\sim$13 SN targets of interest.}  As detailed below
in the Description of Observations, our request for 20 ToO orbits in
Cycle 23 will provide the colors for initial classifications, the
post-Frontier epochs for full light curve sampling, and grism
spectroscopy or medium band IR
imaging for classifications and redshifts of the unique strongly
lensed SN sample.
